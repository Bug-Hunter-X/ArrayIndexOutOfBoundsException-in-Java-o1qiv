# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common runtime exception in Java: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The exception occurs when an attempt is made to access an array element with an index that is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to prevent unexpected program termination.
